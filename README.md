/ > to see ahead in Taipei, Taipei to see uncle the place that the family life, the mood is very complex.
Do you want to write this article, some contradictions.
Finally decided to write, for love, for ordinary people's affection, blood is thicker than water of affection to witness the ordinary people.
Early last century 40 s, just out of the school's uncle from fuzhou single one to Taiwan for a living, work in the post office in Taipei.
Last century 40 s, have a foothold uncle wrote to the unemployed in fuzhou, my parents, let them bring my grandma to go to Taipei together life.
Father is likely to be out of self-esteem, did not materialise.
Grandmother so had been with us a life, never seen only son.
Can't know my uncle how to miss his mother and sister in Taipei, cannot know how grandma channel partition missing son.
The vast sky, time sad, the family always are.
Can't direct communication, and by other relatives and submitted to the peace, a book, not only to describe!
Difficult time, uncle to find ways to support our home, although is a drop in the ocean.
Mother is repeatedly profession has to break up with my uncle, so during the cultural revolution in brief class write check down labor, besides husband reason is to pick a cap to the right, and because there is a brother in Taiwan.
My grandmother is died in fuzhou during the period of cultural revolution, cannot inform my uncle, actually even noticed it is no use.
Mother passed away and unable to attend, my uncle has been pain in my heart, why is life and death are not filial son of man!
In the early eighty s, my parents met in Hong Kong with my uncle family, young don't sea wave, white hair embrace headache heartbroken, sentiment, scene, attendees all to tears.
Cousin cousin beside them will be filmed the scene, when old people look at these photos, is still in tears.
I once wrote a song lyrics elicits emotions: autumn mist, emotions and margin of the rain.
At the family member, across the strait, longing for your return not back another year, helpless sides with frost.
USES the vast covering his eyes, and the rain continuously sorrow is long, life is short.
Under the rain misty...
Under the rain misty, margin of the rain.
Across the strait, and looking forward to the family member gets storm heavy meet, let the smiling face filled with tears.
Rain heavily to ourselves?
The rain falls all rosy clouds now!
Under the rain misty ┄ ┄ then we associate closely, mom went to Taipei, lived for more than a month.
My uncle back to fuzhou rebuild my grandmother's tomb, took my aunt Cousins came to visit my cousin, also a visit to the wuyi mountain.
They come with the color TV refrigerators, they walk along father making the exhibition of works by myself.
Uncle aunt is very like the exhibition works, decoration in each room, took photos sent to us, to show his love.
There is quite a view, uncle was good chatting with my father's.
Aunt Cousins enthusiasm and cheerful love to chat, it is late, or spirit very much, also talk to the wee hours subject is wide, amorous feelings of the folk custom political history geography, all care about.
Although my aunt is a Taiwanese, since the childhood to accept education in Japan, Japanese is good, but there is always a between words the pride of the Chinese nation, the Chinese sense of justice.
Husband and wife worship, pecking order, the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation is in their family get inheritance.
Said these, later have verify facts.
A few years ago, my uncle, my father died one after another, both family in grief.
Although after move between each other, less is often on the phone, communication between mother and aunt send pictures.
Unexpectedly, aunt there and a great event happened recently.
Big cousin gave birth to a men and two women, a small girl here to study medicine in Beijing.
I received last month in Beijing also read her daughter's mobile phone text messages, a little serious Veda father liver disease be in hospital, need to change the liver, her brother hao contributed two-thirds of the liver to save the father.
Small Veda said that her father because work favour, in a hurry to go to an academic conference, continuous work tired and fall.
Mother had to keep their siblings sa, be afraid influence their learning, also hope that the liver source a backlog of brain death.
Later situation more and more urgent, such as liver source can't wait, to bring their siblings to Taipei.
After matching test, small house decided to donate liver.
Small house at 12 noon into surgery, at about 2 PM about the news, can find the matching source of liver.
Operation risk is great, for 16 hours, two people can be said to be alive.
Through GOOGLE search, I detected the Taipei journalists su-chin jiang wrote a report on the matter, the full text is as follows: "the son donated liver to save the father
Love is a kind of seeds, is also a kind of beautiful fruit.
In spite of the growth process may be quite difficult, hope and disappointment always accompany, but again big disappointment will never give my love to give up, in addition to blood, and the grace of teachers, and brotherhood, and the friendship of classmates.
I know my life can't give up in life can give nature, environment, society, and the love of others, because the good has been separated from my life is a moment not.
